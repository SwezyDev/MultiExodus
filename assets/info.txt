                            Multi Exodus

MultiExodus is a Python-based utility designed to manage multiple Exodus wallets. It allows users to import, backup, edit, and switch wallets through a clean and intuitive graphical interface built with CustomTkinter.

The application provides features such as wallet detection, seed phrase recovery automation, image and note customization, and one-click wallet loading into Exodus. Each wallet is stored in a dedicated folder, enabling safe backups and easy organization. The program also implements confirmation dialogs and automated restoration triggers to ensure safe wallet operations.

MultiExodus leverages PIL for image handling, OS-level commands for wallet management, and scrollable, grid-based UI frames for efficient display and interaction with multiple wallets.
