## 🚩 Project overview

**MultiExodus** is a Python-based utility designed to **manage multiple Exodus wallets**. It allows users to import, backup, edit, and switch wallets through a clean and intuitive **graphical interface** built with CustomTkinter.

The application provides features such as **wallet detection**, **seed phrase recovery automation**, **image and note customization**, and **one-click wallet loading into Exodus**. Each wallet is stored in a dedicated folder, enabling safe backups and easy organization. The program also implements **confirmation dialogs and automated restoration triggers** to ensure safe wallet operations.

MultiExodus leverages **PIL for image handling**, **OS-level commands for wallet management**, and **scrollable, grid-based UI frames** for efficient display and interaction with multiple wallets.

---

## ✨ Features

* 💼 **Multi-Wallet Management** — Detect, add, edit, and delete multiple Exodus wallets in a single interface.
* 🔄 **Seamless Wallet Switching** — Load any wallet into Exodus instantly with one click, without manual file handling.
* 🗂️ **Backup & Recovery Automation** — Automatically trigger Exodus recovery mode, backup existing wallets, and restore seed phrases safely.
* 🖼️ **Custom Wallet Notes & Images** — Assign personalized names, notes, and images to each wallet for easy identification.
* 📊 **Organized UI** — Scrollable, grid-based layout with clean, interactive frames built using CustomTkinter.
* ✅ **Safety Prompts** — Confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions like deleting or overwriting wallets to prevent accidental loss.

---

## 🎹 Keybinds
* ❌ **ESC** — Close Windows
* 🗑️ **DEL** — Delete all Wallets
* ℹ️ **F1** — Show Information Box
* 🔁 **F5** — Reload Wallets
* ➕ **+** — Add a Wallet
* ➖ **-** — Delete the oldest Wallet
* 📥 * — Load oldest Wallet

---

## 📥 Easy Installation
1. Download the [Installer](https://github.com/SwezyDev/MultiExodus/releases/download/1.0.0/Multi.Exodus.Installer.exe)
2. Follow the Installer Instructions
3. Run Multi Exodus

---

## 🧭 How It Works

1. Run the application (`python main.py`).
   MultiExodus will create or use your existing MultiExodus directory.
2. Browse your wallets in the scrollable grid UI.
   Each wallet appears with its name, image, note, and action buttons.
3. Choose an action:
   * ➕ **Add Wallet** — Triggers Exodus' built‑in recovery mode, lets you enter your seed phrase, and then saves the restored wallet under a custom name.
   * 📥 **Load Wallet** — Copies the selected wallet into the official Exodus directory and starts Exodus automatically.
   * 📂 **Open Wallet Location** — Open the Location where your wallet is saved.
4. Changes are applied instantly, and the UI rebuilds itself to reflect your updated wallet list.
   * ✏️ **Edit Wallet** — Click on the wallet name, note, or image to rename it, change its description, or assign a custom PNG preview.
   * 🗑️ **Delete Wallet** — Removes the wallet folder after confirmation.
4. Changes are applied instantly, and the UI rebuilds itself to reflect your updated wallet list.

> ✅ Wallets are stored as separate folders inside your MultiExodus directory. Loading a wallet replaces the active Exodus wallet files — always make backups when needed.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

* 🐍 Python **3.9+**
* 📦 Dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install pillow customtkinter
  ```
* 💻 [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/download) installed and working.
* 💾 Access to your Exodus installation directory and multi-wallet folder (ensure the app has permission to read/write files).
* 🖼️ Optional: PNG images for custom wallet previews. (Recommended size: 130x130)

---

## 🔑 Notes on Safety & Usage

* Only run MultiExodus on machines you own or where you have explicit permission.
* Always backup your wallets before adding, loading, or deleting them. MultiExodus will overwrite the active Exodus wallet when loading another.
* Carefully follow prompts during seed phrase recovery — entering incorrect data can corrupt a wallet.
* PNG images and notes are stored locally; deleting or renaming files outside the app may break wallet previews.

## 🧠 Recovery Mode Trigger

How i found the trigger to enter the Recovery Mode:

<img width="753" height="652" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-23 045631" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6677ffe-091b-4d31-a41a-316303f1d9b9" />

You can see that a file was created by Exodus called `restore-mnemonic` in the `%appdata%\Exodus` directory.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Details

* Detects wallets by scanning `MULTI_WALLET_DIR` and sorting by creation time.
* Allows adding, renaming, editing notes/images, deleting, and loading wallets into Exodus.
* Backs up current Exodus wallet before importing new wallets using the restore-mnemonic trigger.
* Custom UI with `customtkinter`, including scrollable grid, interactive buttons, and labels.
* Loads and resizes wallet images with `PIL`, with optional rounded corners.
* Uses `MyInputDialog` for custom modal input prompts.
* Manages Exodus.exe with `ctypes` message boxes, `os.startfile`, and `taskkill`.
* Performs file operations using `shutil` and `pathlib`.
* Updates window title with wallet count and current time via a background thread.

## 📣 Final note

MultiExodus is a personal wallet‑management helper, built to let users organize and switch between multiple Exodus wallets more efficiently.
It does not modify Exodus itself and is not affiliated with Exodus or any other vendor.

Use it responsibly, securely, and only on systems and wallets you own and control. Always keep backups of important wallets, and never share your seed phrases with anyone — including this tool.
